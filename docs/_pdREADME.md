# Simultaneously Constant or Almost Constant Segments Detection
____

This is just a programming exercise and not a full-featured, production-ready software.\
It compares two data sets and searches for simultaneously constant or almost constant segments. You can easily extend the functionality to more than two data sets.

Run:

    $./constsegm.py  data_file  epsilon_1 epsilon_2
